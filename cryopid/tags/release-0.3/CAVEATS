Things that work but may break:

 - eflags is restored from the process's stack. If the process wasn't using a
   stack in the normal sense, or was 4 bytes off overflowing, badness will
   ensue.
 - syscalls are restarted. Syscall detection works by seeing if the last
   instruction executed /ends/ with 0x80cd ... this is not reliable.
